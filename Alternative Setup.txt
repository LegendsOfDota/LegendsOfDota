1. Unzip LoD Repository
2. Open script_generator\settings_example.txt, add your dota diretory, rename settings_example.txt to settings.txt
3. Run compile.bat
4. run altSetup.bat, it should create "alt_dota" folder, with "content" and "game" folder inside. 
5. If you haven't already, create a new empty mod folder with the Dota 2 workshop tools program. When you create it, the foldies will not literally be empty, thats good, you need those default files.
